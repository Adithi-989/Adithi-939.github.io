# About Me
## My Hobbies
- **Reading**: I enjoy reading as a pasttime! I like to read all different types of genres, but the ones I enjoy most are Fantasy and Historical Fiction. I'm currently reading _The Crucible_ as an assigned reading for my AP Language and Composition class in high school. I have not gotten past Act 1 yet, but I am excited to read it more!
- **Art**: I have always liked drawing, and I started when I was around 7 to 10 years old. I enjoy traditional art the most, although I think it will be fun to try digital art. I have not drawn in a while since school has been very busy for me, but I am trying to get back into drawing again!
## Websites That I find Interesting
-  [Notion][cute]- I find Notion very useful when it comes to keeping track of items. I have customised a Notion page for myself where I keep an assignment tracker and a calendar so I don't miss any work!
- [YouTube][cuute]- YouTube is my savior, especially whenever I can't understand a concept, or I just want to kill some free time. It has a plethora of videos on so many different concepts, and sometimes I just like to scroll and learn some new facts!
